Hello there, happy you found me! I’m Heather (@heathermoule)! My pronouns are she/her/hers.

I'm currently a hydrologist who deals with a lot of different environmental data, QA/QC data, and various data structures.
That being said, a lot of my time gets bogged down in administrative and management work. 
I'm looking for a change! I'm passionate about cleaning, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data.
I love learning new things and I love improving things even more. Excited for whats to come!

In my free time, I like to play video games, board games, and get outside for some nature photography (especially wildlife!). 
I have two rambunctious Tuxedo cats and a supporting husband who shares a love of technology. 

Anyways, its nice to meet you and feel free to reach out to me! - moulehea@gmail.com
I think collaboration is the best way to learn and I have a lot of fun doing it.
